## The Algorithm

For my project I decided to train AI on understanding letters in ASL. I re-trained the ResNet-18 model on 750 images per letter, including delete, space, and none. This will allow the user to either upload a photo or a image stream (from a camera or video scource) and output it to a file, a Real-Time Streaming Protocol (RTSP), or WebRTC.
